# Handwritten math equation solver

We can approach this problem statement in the following steps:

1. We are given a dataset of images for different Math symbols using which we can train our Image classification model to classify images as math symbols.
2. Now, we take an image with complete math equation and try to segregate each symbol into smaller images
3. Pass these smaller images to find the actual symbol and then solve the equation as a normal math equation.
